Hi people.
My names are Martin Dibox. I'm from Nairobi,Kenya and currently a student. 
I'm a 21 year old boy who has one younger brother. 
I'm very passionate about changing the world to make it a better place through codes and programmes and I also like computers a lot.
I someday wish to become a computer engineer and software developer/specialist.
